# Whatsapp Clone (ReactJS)
 
 This is a project made in ReactJS and NextJS. The main idea of the project was copy the Whatsapp web interface. I also created some example chats to simulate the chats in the application. To generate the profile pictures, i also get the pictures from the "picsum" website. This website generates a random profile picture in the size that you want.
